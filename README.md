Frank.py README

Welcome to the Frank.py project! Frank is an open source, text based python module that is designed to act as a personal assistant program. 

It is worth noting that there will also be a C# version of Frank available on my Github page if there isn't already.

It is also worth noting, perhaps very importantly, that this program relies on the getpass module, so if you want to run it on windows, you'll have to use command prompt, rather than something like MINGW64, as I tried to do for a while 

The Frank project is very simple and easy to use. I didn't want to create a Vim like control scheme, I just wanted a simple, text based environment to perform basic functions like a notepad. This is especially helpful given that I hate all of the in built text editors on any given operating system.

As a result of the simplistic control scheme, Frank is absolutely not in need of a detailed wiki or readme file, thus why I haven't created one. If you want to add functions to it, I would love to hear about what you've done and you can contact me through my github.

Hope you like the program,
Iain
