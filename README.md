Frank.py README

Welcome to the Frank.py project! Frank is an open source, text based python module that is designed to act as a personal assistant program. 

It is worth noting that there will also be a C# version of Frank available on my Github page if there isn't already. 

The Frank project is very simple and easy to use. I didn't want to create a Vim like control scheme, I just wanted a simple, text based environment to perform basic functions like a notepad. This is especially helpful given that I hate all of the in built text editors on any given operating system.

As a result of the simplistic control scheme, Frank is absolutely not in need of a detailed wiki or readme file, thus why I haven't created one. If you want to add functions to it, I would love to hear about what you've done and you can contact me through my github.

Hope you like the program,
Iain
